Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. The environment we are using is called \"notebook\" where we can use a mix of markdown cells (like this one) and code blocks that execute code using a python interpreter.\n",
